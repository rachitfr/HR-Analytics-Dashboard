# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze employee attrition, workforce demographics, salary distribution, and tenure patterns. The project transforms raw HR data into interactive insights to support data-driven HR decisions, identify risk areas, and improve employee retention strategies.

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze employee attrition and key workforce metrics. The dashboard highlights overall attrition rate, average age, salary, years at company, and employee distribution across departments and roles, enabling quick understanding of organizational health.

The analysis explores attrition trends by education background, age group, salary slab, job role, gender, and years at the company. These insights help identify high-risk segments, such as roles or salary ranges with higher attrition, supporting informed HR planning and retention strategies 

This project is suitable for HR teams and data analysts seeking practical experience in workforce analytics, KPI design, and dashboard storytelling using real-world HR data.
